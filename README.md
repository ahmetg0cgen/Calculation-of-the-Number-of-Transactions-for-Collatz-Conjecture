## 📌 Features
✅ A structure has been created that shows how even numbers that are not powers of two gradually reach 1 with the Collatz function.

✅ A structure has been developed that calculates how many operations it takes for even numbers that are not powers of two to reach 1 using the Collatz function.

✅ A function has been developed that graphs how many operations it takes for even numbers that are not powers of two to reach 1.

## 🔧 Requirements
📌 Python 3.x

📌 Matplotlib

For installation:

`pip install matplotlib`

## 📊 Model Description
In this model:

- The Collatz function is applied exclusively to even numbers that are not powers of 2.
- The program iterates through all numbers up to a given limit and filters out powers of 2 before applying the Collatz sequence.
- A visualization is provided to show the number of steps required for each starting value to reach 1.
- The results allow for an analysis of how the modified Collatz process behaves when excluding powers of 2.

### 🌌 Theoretical Background
#### 🔹 1. Basis of Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture, proposed by German mathematician Lothar Collatz in 1937, is a mathematical problem defined as follows:

Given a positive integer, a sequence is generated by following these steps:

- If the number is even, divide it by 2.
- If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
- Repeat the process with the new number.
  
The Collatz Conjecture suggests that for any initial number, when this process is repeated, the sequence will always eventually reach 1. In other words, regardless of the starting number, the sequence will always converge to 1. Despite being tested for a large range of numbers, a general proof or disproof remains elusive.

This conjecture can be expressed mathematically as follows:

$$
f^{[g]}(n) = \begin{cases}
n/2, & \text{n even} \\
3n + 1, & \text{n odd} 
\end{cases}
$$

#### 🔹 2. Advanced Analysis

As a result of the results obtained in the article of the same name, it was understood that the following formula will be the cornerstone for examining even numbers that are not multiples of 2:

$$
\left(\frac{3^{i+1} \cdot 2^{m-1}}{2^i} + \frac{3^{i+1}k}{2^i} + \sum_{j=0}^{i} \frac{3^j}{2^j}\right) + 1 = 2^l
$$

## 🚀 Operation
To run the project:

`python col_model.py` and `python colgr_model.py`

## 📈 Output
When the code is run:

- The Collatz sequences for even numbers that are not powers of 2 will be generated and displayed.
- A graph will be created showing the number of steps required for each starting number to reach 1.
- This visualization provides insight into how the Collatz process behaves when excluding powers of 2.

## 🔍 Advanced Development Suggestions
- Code efficiency can be increased for analysis of larger numbers.
- The relationship with formulas can be coded in more detail and the formula structure can be analyzed in more detail.
- Regression compatible codes can be developed for potential patterns in the created graphs.
